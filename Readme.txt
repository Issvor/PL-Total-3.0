PLTotal 3.0
This is an unfinished version of 3.0, because I'm still learning certain features that I want to incorporate. Version 3.1 will be the polished version of this.
The code is more organized with each method being its own class now. (This was mainly for me to get used to calling other classes rather than methods and better learning how to use return.)
Added a feature that outputs (hardcoded, for now) stats and asks the user whether or not these are current. If yes, simply put in your body weight and you'll be done. If no, put in the weight and reps like in version 2.0.
When finished, the program creates a file named "PLTotalLog.txt" and outputs the date the program was ran and with the goal messages so the user doesn't have to only use the program to get updates.

Up coming features:
	- Make the "current" stats dynamic and allow the user to have a file that the program reads for stats.
	- Let the user set the goals instead of having hardcoded values (this will be really tricky, since the program is based around MY goals of bodyweight, rather than just whatever weight lifted).
	- Add more info to the PLTotalLog file.
